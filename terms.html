                        <h4>GO AND TOW TRAILER TRAINING TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h4>

                        <p>These terms and conditions will apply to all initial and subsequent bookings made by an individual or company. These terms are available publicly, including on our website and correspondence.
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Driving License Candidates must produce their valid driving licence with necessary provisional entitlements (and theory test pass certificate if applicable) in order to be able to undertake training and DVSA tests. (Failure
                            to produce may result in the course and test being cancelled and loss of all fees). It is the candidate&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure they have all or any necessary entitlements or provisions to undertake the training and
                            or tests required, both upon booking and when attending any courses or DVSA tests. Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot be liable for the candidate being booked onto the incorrect course. We can only provide advice and guidance
                            on information given to us, it is not legally binding. Any traffic offences committed fines and or penalty points incurred during training or tests are the responsibility of the candidate. If your licence requires you to wear
                            corrective lenses for driving you must bring them onto the course with you. Tow and Go Trailer Training reserve the right not to undertake training if the licence conditions are not met for the training and or tests. Should
                            for any reason the candidate not present their driving licence for test, Tow and Go Trailer Training hold no responsibility or liability as it is the licence holder&rsquo;s responsibility. It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility
                            to keep hold of their licence when passing a test, if they are undertaking another practical test such as an Initial Driver CPC test.</p>

                        <p>2. Vehicle Insurance &ldquo;Trailer Training UK Ltd.&rsquo;s&rdquo; insurance provides cover whilst candidates are driving our vehicles providing that they hold an appropriate full / provisional driving entitlement and are supervised
                            by our staff or accompanied by a DVSA examiner for the purpose of a test. If providing your own vehicle for training and tests you must ensure it is suitably insured and provide proof if required to the DVSA examiner or instructor
                            of your course, that your vehicle is covered for the purpose of driving instruction and tests. Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot be held responsible if the DVSA do not conduct the test if the above is not satisfied with appropriate
                            documentation or for any related reason. Other activities involved in training can be hazardous and candidates are urged to exercise extreme care always. We cannot accept any liability, or responsibility, for personal injury
                            however so caused.</p>

                        <p>Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot accept any responsibility for any candidate&rsquo;s loss or damage to possessions, vehicles or effects whilst on our premises (in our vehicles). We are also not responsible for customer storage
                            and therefore candidates are encouraged to bring as few possessions as feasible with them for training. Trailer Training UK do endeavour but are not obliged to provide free customer parking on-site, candidates should satisfy
                            themselves of these arrangements before attending.</p>

                        <p>3. Vehicles If using our vehicles and or trailers we will ensure that they are compliant and roadworthy to fit the DVSA minimum test vehicle requirements as applicable. If for any reason a company vehicle is prevented from going
                            out on training we will endeavour to solve this in the most prompt manner, however we are not responsible for any training lost during this time. Tow and Go Trailer Training reserve the right to not undertake the training or
                            test, if it is felt that the candidate is not following instructions given to them, treating the equipment with respect and vehicle sympathy, utilising the vehicle in the correct and safe manner. If using your own vehicle and
                            or trailers you are responsible to ensure the above and provide documents for inspection by the DVSA if required. You must also provide a spare rear rectangular number plate and additional mirrors for the instructors and examiner&rsquo;s
                            use if using our trailers. When candidates are supplying their own suitable towing vehicle(s) for DVSA tests, they are responsible for ensuring the vehicle meets with the DVSA minimum test vehicle requirements. Tow and Go Trailer
                            Training cannot be held responsible or financially liable if training or DVSA tests cannot be conducted if failure of the above. Any unnecessary damage or wear and tear caused to the vehicles by the candidate during training
                            may incur additional fees, including a minimum &pound;40 surcharge, which would be invoiced with payment required within 7 days. This will be determined following inspection / assessment by company staff or if necessary by
                            a manufacturer, authorised repairer or technician. Vehicles and instructors are subject to availability throughout the duration of your course and may be changed without notice to the candidate this does not affect the statutory
                            rights of the customer or provide any lesser standard of service. We will do our best to of course ensure that you stay with the same instructor and vehicle throughout the course of the training. The candidate will not be entitled
                            to any benefit in kind, reimbursement of fees, or any right to cancel or re-arrange the training.</p>

                        <p>4. Number Plates If supplying your own vehicle for training you must ensure you bring a rear number plate for our trailer if provided. Failure to supply a rear number plate may result in some or all or parts of the course being
                            cancelled. The course would then need to be re-booked at additional cost to the customer.</p>

                        <p>5. Health and Safety Tow and Go Trailer Training will make available PPE for training where necessary e.g. high visibility vests and gloves; you are advised to wear this at all times when outside the vehicle and when handling the
                            vehicle. Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot be responsible for injury or other consequences because of the customer failing to wear any PPE provided. Warm / waterproof clothing, gloves and suitable footwear is the customer&rsquo;s
                            responsibility; you should come appropriately dressed for the weather and conditions. Short regular breaks will be taken throughout the duration of your course as managed or deemed suitable by your instructor. Breaks are an
                            important part of the training to get the candidate to the required standard for the DVSA test / course objective. However, should an instructor deem it unsafe to continue training with the candidate, despite best managing
                            the time, and need to finish training earlier than planned the candidate is not entitled for that remaining time to be re-arranged or reimbursed, this remains at the discretion of Trailer Training UK Ltd.</p>

                        <p>6. Course Bookings A course is deemed booked upon either a verbal agreement over the phone and/ or course confirmation details being issued to the customer. The terms and conditions of the booking are available on our website and
                            correspondence sent to the candidate. The company will also require a correctly completed course form for additional details including driving licence (check codes) and theory confirmation. Without this Tow and Go Trailer Training
                            reserve the right to cancel the booking as not to breach third party regulations. Full payment is required upon booking, or if a deposit made, any balance met 10 clear working days before the course/ training begins. The company
                            will send automated frequent reminders to customers about this and therefore reserve the right to not undertake training or provide courses if all or any one of these conditions are not met in the required time frames. If course
                            dates are provided or you&rsquo;re provisionally booked on a course this does not qualify as a confirmed booking until the above terms are met. Candidates will need to ensure they have the correct provisional entitlements for
                            the course they are booked on; it is the candidate&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure they are booked onto the correct course. Tow and Go Trailer Training can only advise but do not accept legal responsibility; no refunds can
                            be made for a course booking different to that subsequently needed or desired by the candidate. If a package is booked and a part of the package has been started, No refunds of the full cost including deposits can be given.</p>

                        <p>7. Deposits and Cancellations A &pound;250 deposit is required at the time of booking. All deposits are non-refundable once paid. If a course is booked within 10 clear working days of the course start date the full payment is required
                            at time of booking and is non-refundable. The course and DVSA test are not assigned to the customer if payment is not received. It is the candidate&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure payments are received to us on time. Notice
                            of cancellation or re-arrangement of a course, or part of, must be given in writing (email accepted, but candidate must ensure we have received it) no less than 10 clear working days (Mon-Fri) prior to the commencement date
                            of the course. If the above notice is not given, we reserve the right to charge the full outstanding balance. We shall however do our best to reallocate the course dates to another client and if successful refund some of the
                            original course amount. Payment of outstanding balances must be made 10 clear working days prior to commencement of training, this includes postage time of cheques and transfer time on BACS being taken into consideration.</p>

                        <p>8. Disruption to courses and DVSA Tests We make every effort to ensure that courses go ahead as arranged. We cannot, however, be held responsible or financially liable for disruptions / re-arrangements caused by unforeseen instructor
                            illness, inclement weather conditions, unforeseen traffic delays or accidents, unforeseen mechanical breakdown including blown bulbs, punctures or any other mechanical issue; or postponement and / or cancellation of tests by
                            the DVSA. In the event a DVSA test being cancelled the candidate must rebook additional training time and if necessary a test with the company, paying the necessary fees. The candidate should then look to claim any expenses
                            or costs from the DVSA using the claim form provided. If for any reason the candidate is unsatisfied with the conduct of the examiner when on a test, it is recommended that they contact the DVSA imminently using the feedback
                            form provided by the DVSA examiner. The location, date and time of the test is subject to availability and can be determined by the DVSA or other factors at any time. Tow and Go Trailer Training have no control over this and
                            therefore cannot be held responsible for which location the test is due to take place. The candidate will have no claim to the company regarding any DVSA test matters. Courses cannot be cancelled or rearranged, nor any refunds
                            given under any circumstances including illness, death, injuries or bereavements.</p>

                        <p>9. Bad weather In the event of bad or severe weather including but not limited to snow, ice, floods high winds etc, Tow and Go Trailer Training have to comply with the DVSA bad weather policy which can be found at https://www.gov.uk/practical-driving-test-for-cars/cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather.
                            Tow and Go Trailer Training have no control of knowing if or when the DVSA will cancel the driving test and therefore the DVSA&rsquo;s policy is that all students must attend the driving test centre for the test until Tow and
                            Go Trailer Training are told otherwise by the DVSA. In the event of such adverse weather, training will continue as planned from our training centre or other site&rsquo;s when it is deemed safe and suitable to do so by Trailer
                            Training UK Ltd. All training will proceed unless you are contacted by Trailer Training UK Ltd. Where training can proceed as explained above, Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot be held responsible for customers not being able
                            to arrive to start their training due to adverse weather from their own location or on-route, and fees cannot be refunded and training cannot be re-arranged for another date. In the event that Tow and Go Trailer Training decides
                            it is unsafe or unsuitable for training to proceed, then we will look to re-arrange the training time missed or set up a credit note for an equal amount to this customer. Please note that, in this instance, any compensation
                            deemed appropriate by Tow and Go Trailer Training will be granted at the earliest convenience and will not be available to exchange for a refund or monetary value of any kind. In the event that the customer is still able to
                            undertake their test as determined by the DVSA, despite our best efforts, Tow and Go Trailer Training cannot be responsible for the student not being at the required test standard due to having missed training due to the adverse
                            weather conditions.</p>

                        <p>10. Behaviour and Conduct of the Candidate Tow and Go Trailer Training reserve the right to terminate the course immediately and with no notice should the candidate or their party become abusive, prove to be unwilling to carry
                            out instructions given, and is felt to be a danger to themselves, other road users, mistreatment of the company&rsquo;s vehicles or equipment or to &ldquo;Trailer Training UK Ltd.&rsquo;s&rdquo; staff. Likewise, any inappropriate
                            behaviour by the candidate or if the instructor feels that the candidate is suffering from the effects of alcohol, drugs or lack of sleep shall result in the termination of training. No refund will be given in these circumstances.
                            Tow and Go Trailer Training reserves the right to withhold the use of its vehicles and staff for the driving test if for any reason it is felt by our staff that the candidate has not reached the required standard to drive safely
                            without instruction. No refund will be given in these circumstances. Tow and Go Trailer Training will not tolerate, rudeness, swearing or abusive language to any members of our team, if this occurs the candidate in question
                            will be dismissed straight away with no financial claim to the company.</p>

                        <p>11. Trailer Handling and Caravan Courses All caravan and trailer handling courses are with customers own vehicle and trailer or caravan, we can however when pre-arranged supply a caravan / trailer if the customer prefers for a
                            small additional fee (&pound;10+VAT). Customers vehicles must have a suitable and working tow bar and electrics, our trailers are fitted with a standard 50mm tow ball Coupling and 7 pin electrics. It&rsquo;s the customer&rsquo;s

                            towing vehicle there will be an additional Fee (&pound;10 + VAT)</p>
